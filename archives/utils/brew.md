# homebrew

In the [[shell]] I use `homebrew` as my package-manager

## taps

```shell
brew tap
```

## what I installed

```shell
brew leaves
```

## remove everything I don't want

```shell
brew autoremove
```

## aliases

Now I can use `brew pip requests` to install pythonr-pip

```shell
brew alias
```

## casks

```shell
brew list --cask
```

## trivial things

### JAVAHOME

<https://github.com/Homebrew/discussions/discussions/2530#discussioncomment-2002374> Installing Java-dependent formulae from bottle mirrors doesn't work properly at the moment. The issue is that brew needs the manifest in order to correctly replace @@HOMEBREW_{JAVA}@@ but brew only knows how to fetch manifests from ghcr.io.

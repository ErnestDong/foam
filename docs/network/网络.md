## sockets

其实就是 IP+端口号

A socket is one endpoint of a two-way communication link between two programs running on the network.

A socket is bound to a port number so that the TCP layer can identify the application that data is destined to be sent to.

## direct connection & reverse connection

IP can be dynamic. So direct connection may have problems

A reverse connection is usually used to bypass firewall restrictions on open ports.

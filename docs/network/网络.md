# 计算机网络基础

计算机系统交换 message 通过通信链路和分组交换机链接。交换机分为 router 和 link-layer-switch

## IP and Ports

show all my ports

```shell
netstat -abn
```

common ports

| [[http]]   | 80  |
| ftp    | 20  |
| [[smtp]]   | 25  |
| pop3   | 110 |
| imap4  | 143 |
| telnet | 23  |

## direct connection & reverse connection

IP can be dynamic. So direct connection may have problems

A reverse connection is usually used to bypass firewall restrictions on open ports.

## [[OSI模型]]

## [[socket]]

其实就是 IP+端口号

A socket is one endpoint of a two-way communication link between two programs running on the network.

A socket is bound to a port number so that the TCP layer can identify the application that data is destined to be sent to.
